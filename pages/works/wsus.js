                    Nearly 90% of the world's PCs are running Windows.
                    Therefore, it is important for various reasons (security, stability, availability of applications) to keep the operating systems up to date.
                    These reasons explain the implementation of this project.
                    <br/><br/>Microsoft offers updates that are done individually on each PC of the IUT. This represents a huge amount of data because the PCs go one by one to look for their updates on the Internet. This is not optimized and uses a lot of
                    bandwidth. We must therefore create an installation similar to the simplified diagram
                    below:

                I am pleased to report that the installation of this server was a success.
                This project was undertaken in order to improve the process of updating the operating systems on PCs running Windows.
                It is important to keep these systems up to date for the sake of security, stability, and the availability of applications.
                <br/>Our team implemented a new system, as illustrated in the simplified diagram, to optimize the update process and reduce the use of bandwidth.
                <br/><br/>I am grateful to my tutors, Flavien M and Yann B, for their guidance and support during this project.
