                Every year, at ESNA, a logo representing the new class of students (of which I belong) is created. In 2022 it was up to me to design it.
                <br/>I'm going to share with you the process of creation of this logo
                </P>

                    At ESNA, all the promotions have a logo representing a kind of animal (hydra, fox), this year will not derogate from the rule.
                    At first we had to decide what kind of animal we would choose.
                    <br/>Finally we had 7 possible choices of animals/Monsters that we had to choose from :<br/><br/>
                    <OrderedList>
                        <ListItem ml={4}>Minotaur</ListItem>
                        <ListItem ml={4}>Trojan hors</ListItem>

                        <ListItem ml={4}>Cerberus</ListItem>
                        <ListItem ml={4}>Griffon</ListItem>
                        <ListItem ml={4}>God</ListItem>
                        <ListItem ml={4}>Raven</ListItem>
                    </OrderedList>
                    <br/>Following a vote in several rounds, the raven was chosen. Then began a long process of logo creation.
                    I say long because in reality it was important that the logo pleases the majority of the students (~40 people!).
                    <br/>With the following images, you're going to discover the different stages of creation of the logo.

                <Text mb={3}>7Ô∏è‚É£ But in the end, this version was chosen by the students. I'm proud of the work done, it was quit a long process, both timewise and mentally.  : </Text>

                    Normally the logo is white on a black background but for the clarity of this page I chose to do the opposite
                    <br/>In a near futur, this logo is going to be used on hoodies for the students ! I will add photos when the hoodies are delivered.
