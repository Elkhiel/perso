                For my second year at the DUT R&T of Saint-Malo, we decided to create our own project. The realization of a complete website, in order to learn network ðŸ—¿.

                Today, there are a lot of resources on the internet to learn all kinds of things.
                Ranging from a simple recipe, to a complete tutorial to set up complex protocols on a professional server.
                <br/><br/>On the other hand, the observation that we made between R&T students is the following :
                Although we consume a lot of online content, the vast majority of us had no real
                real network knowledge.
                <br/><br/>This phenomenon may be partly due to the fact that the network, at first glance, may seem "cluttered".
                <br/>This makes it more complicated to grasp for a neophyte without guidance. It is therefore from this reflection that
                the concept of our project came to us:
                <br/><br/>âœ¨ Create a website for the general public, allowing an accessible learning of the network.
